# smoking_cessation_prediction
a Machine Learning model to predict whether an individual is likely to quit smoking based on their health and lifestyle attributes
EvaluationMetrics:
1. Classification Accuracy: Measure of the model's overall accuracy in correctly predicting whether an individual will quit smoking or not.
2. Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC): Evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between individuals who quit smoking and those who did not.
Dataset Description - 
1. **age:** Age of the individuals, grouped in 5-year gaps.
2. **height (cm):** Height of the individuals in centimeters.
3. **weight (kg):** Weight of the individuals in kilograms.
4. **waist (cm):** Waist circumference length, which can be an indicator of abdominal obesity.
5. **eyesight (left):** Eyesight measurement for the left eye.
6. **eyesight (right):** Eyesight measurement for the right eye.
7. **hearing (left):** Hearing measurement for the left ear.
8. **hearing (right):** Hearing measurement for the right ear.
9. **systolic:** Systolic blood pressure, which is the higher number in a blood pressure reading.
10. **relaxation:** Diastolic blood pressure, which is the lower number in a blood pressure reading.
11. **fasting blood sugar:** Fasting blood sugar level, which can be an indicator of glucose etabolism.
12. **Cholesterol (total):** Total cholesterol level.
13. **triglyceride:** Triglyceride level, a type of fat found in the blood.
14. **HDL (cholesterol type):** High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, often referred to as "good" cholesterol.
15. **LDL (cholesterol type):** Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level, often referred to as "bad" cholesterol.
16. **hemoglobin:** Hemoglobin level, which is important for carrying oxygen in the blood.
17. **Urine protein:** Presence of protein in urine, which can be an indicator of kidney function.
18. **serum creatinine:** Serum creatinine level, another indicator of kidney function.
19. **AST (glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase type):** AST enzyme level, used to assess liver health.
20. **ALT (glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase type):** ALT enzyme level, also used to assess liver health.
21. **Gtp (Î³-GTP):** Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GTP) level, which can be associated with liver and bile duct function.
22. **dental caries:** Dental caries or tooth decay status.
23. **smoking:** Smoking status, indicating whether an individual is a smoker or non-smoker.
